# Begin  Global Automation Engineer standard template - Ver 3.0.0 Date 2022-02-25  * Master * Refer xxxxx Begin #
# Description
# Software products and versions
# Supported OS platforms : All Unix/Linux variants.
# This sudo profile is required on the 'managed systems' associated 
# to the indicated automation tool set.  Self serve access
# considerations are 'Not applicable' for this template.
#
# Automation Engineer id's may be placed in the 'standard' system 
# admin group and sudo entry -provided- that entry is consistent 
# with the tool's needs.  
# In the event that entry is NOT consistent with the tool needs, then 
# this template can be used instead.
#
#
# Version control
#
# See changelog on Global sudo wiki https://ibm.biz/ChlogMiddlewareTemplates for previous changes
#
# Updates in this version:
#
# V2.0 - pczaldy@us.ibm.com / jekri@dk.ibm.com - new template - based 
#       on NA 209_AutomationEngineer_NA template
# 
#
# V2.0.1 - jekri@dk.ibm.com - functional change - Begin and End lines changed to standard 
#
# V2.1 - pczaldy@us.ibm.com - DA1.0 to DA2.0/ansible transition - add /bin/sh as required by the tool
# 
# V2.2 - pczaldy@us.ibm.com - add shells to enable non-privilege id to non-privilege id su.
#      	   In order to accomodate the ability to do 'su' from one unprivileged
#          user to a second unprivileged user, we are going to enable the 
#          ansible id to 'all shells'.  According to the ansible documentation,
#          this is necessary.  
#          ansible tower will be covering the additional 
#          logging needed for individual accountability when adding the KYNDRYL_SHELLS_ALL.
#           Net:  This allows 'least privilege.'
#          The alternative appears to be requiring running more
#          end point id's to run with full root privilege.
#          https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/become.html
#	   Caution:  ansible tasks will need the following if they are 
#           switching between non-privileged users.
#            become_flags: "-I"
#            ansible_ssh_pipelining: true
#
# V3.0.0 - daniele.palumbo-v-tservices@kyndryl.com - moved the template to Kyndryl
# 
# Special instructions for ansible authors changing context from one non-privileged id to second non-privileged id:
#	   Caution:  ansible tasks will need the following if they are 
#           switching between non-privileged users.
#            become_flags: "-I"
#            ansible_ssh_pipelining: true
#
# User Aliases
#
# Replace sample group names with real group names for your account.
#
# The User_Alias name KYNDRYL_AE_BAU to identify the Alias as an 
#     Automation Engineer alias
#
User_Alias     KYNDRYL_AE_BAU = %automata
#
# If a different group name is used, replace
# %automata with the -group- that contains the account specific 
# automation ids. 

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Host Aliases 
#
# In this template, we assume all systems are managed by the 
# automation.  Indicate a subset of systems if not all will
# be managed by automation and a master file is used.
#
Host_Alias    KYNDRYL_AE_HOSTS = ALL 
#
# ------------- standard content reminder:
#  This entry uses standard aliases (eg: Cmnd_Alias  KYNDRYL_NONE_EDITOR ) 
#  which are defined in:   https://ibm.biz/GsudoStdAlias .  Ensure you 
#  have included all needed standard aliases from this file into the 
#  /etc/sudoers file.
